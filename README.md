this assignment was the most stressful thing especially when using the render.

everytime i change anything i have to git push it and deploy it to see it

i have spent 3 days creating a review page for a hotel

i have made the database and tried to get it to work but i do not think that everything is linked properly

i first struggled with gettting the stars to glow gold when clicked on. but i finally fixed it using google

i made the layout simple but i think it looks professional

i coded the reviews to show at the bottom of the page and also to have a like button but i couldnt get them to work and it was stressing me out so im leaving it as is to hopefully get some help and re submit

ive stressed myself out with this website but i think ive shown that i understand the process even if i couldnt get it to work completely.
